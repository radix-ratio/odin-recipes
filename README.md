# Odin Recipes Project

This repository contains the code for a Recipe App Project, created using HTML. The project was developed as an exercise from the The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It showcases basic HTML structure.

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own projects or for further learning.
