# Odin Recipes Project

This repository contains the code for a Recipe App Project, created using HTML. The project was developed as an exercise from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It showcases basic HTML structure. 

Recipes and photos used in project are from: [Kwestia smaku](https://www.kwestiasmaku.com/) and translated with [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/pl/translator)

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own projects or for further learning.
