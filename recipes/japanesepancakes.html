    <p>Easy recipe for japanese pancakes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of fine sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of milk (30 ml)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (15 g)</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons of wheat flour (45 g)</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of fine sugar (30 g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put egg yolks, fine sugar, milk, vegetable oil and vanilla extract into a bowl. Grind it with a mixer to a smooth paste. Add the flour with the baking powder and again mix with a spatula until smooth.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, place egg whites with salt. Beat to a stiff froth, then gradually, a teaspoon at a time, add sugar, all the while patiently beating the ingredients until the foam is thick, stiff and glossy, without sugar particles.
        </li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of whipped foam to the egg yolk mixture and gently mix with a spoon. Add another 2 - 3 tablespoons of foam and mix again.
            Add the rest of the foam, but in 2 - 3 batches, stirring very gently with a spoon so that the foam does not sink.Heat a non-stick pan (such as a pancake pan) on a high burner, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Grease the pan with a thin layer of oil. Scoop half of the batter in 5 places in the pan, e.g. with an ice cream scoop or a confectionery sleeve with a large opening, or with a regular spoon. You can also fry in metal ramekins for even and high edges. Portions of the batter should be small in diameter, but should be tall.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the pan with a little water and put the lid on. Heat for about 4 minutes, then flip with a spatula to the other side and repeat frying. Remove to a plate. Repeat frying with the rest of the batter. Sprinkle the pancakes with powdered sugar and add your favorite toppings. </li>
    </ol>
